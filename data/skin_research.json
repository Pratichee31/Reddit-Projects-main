        "title": "Best & Worst Skincare Products I’ve tried [review]",
        "body": "Little bit about me/my skin: Im 25F and I have sensitive, acne prone, combination skin. My skin is especially sensitive to fragrance, citrus and floral essential oils. Because of this I’ve become a bit of a skincare nerd and an obsessive ingredients list reader. I definitely still have a lot to learn about skincare but I hope this list helps some of you! Especially my fellow sensitive skin skincare addicts. I tried to keep the reviews very short and straight forward, but if you want me to expand on any products let me know! 1. **La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer 30 SPF - 3/10** *Pros:* Fragrance free and very moisturizing. *Cons:* Broke me out and burned my eyes Best for: dry skin. 2. **Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser - 0/10** *Pros:* literally nothing. *Cons:* I don’t like the smell, it broke me out, didn’t remove my makeup well. 3. **Drunk Elephant Beste No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 6/10** *Pros:* Clean ingredients list. *Cons:* Stripping/drying and expensive. *For who?* Oily skin or those that like to feel squeaky clean. 4. **La Roche-Posay Anthelios Sunscreen 60 SPF (American) - 3/10** *Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast. *Cons:* Greasy, broke me out, stung my eyes. *Bottom Line:* Stick to the European version. 5. **La Roche-Posay Anthelios Sunscreen 50+ SPF (European) - 9/10** *Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast, reasonably priced. *Cons:* texture is a little too runny for my liking. *Bonus:* LRP donates to skin cancer research. 6. **Jordan Samuel Hydrate Facial Serum - 0/10** *Pros:* Couldn’t try long enough to say. *Cons:* Gave me a bright red burning skin reaction. *Bottom Line:* Looks like they changed their formula (for good reason obvi) so I can’t speak for the new version. *For who?* Those who want an excuse to cancel dinner plans. 7. **Mario Badescu Rose Facial Spray - 0/10** *Pros:* Cheap. *Cons:* Mist comes out too strong, I don’t like the smell, contains fragrance, citronellol, geraniol and colorants. *Bottom Line:* Thank goodness it was a gift, because I won’t be buying. 8. **The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser - 5/10** *Pros:* Unscented, affordable. *Cons:* Made my skin itch and left a residue. *Bottom Line:* I won’t repurchase. 9. **A313 Vitamin A Pommade - 10/10** *Pros:* My acne reduced, skin texture improved (after two weeks). Thick vasaline texture that locks in the vitamin A. *Cons:* Slight metallic smell *Bottom Line:* Worth the hype! I use 2x a week max, alternating with a salicylic acid oil. 10. **Youth to the People Superberry Dream Cleansing Balm - 3/10** *Pros:* Great ingredient list, interesting extracts. *Cons:* Smells like waxy crayons, crumbly texture that doesn’t melt well into the skin, left a waxy feeling behind. *Bottom Line:* I’ve tried better. 11. **Tata Harper Water-Lock Moisturizer - 2/10** *Pros:* I liked her organic Vermont farm story and the light gel cream texture. *Cons:* strong fragrance, contains skin irritants like Alcohol, limonene, citral, citronellol, linalool and orange peel extract. *Bottom Line:* Don’t use if you have sensitive skin. There is a sunburn warning on the side of the box because it contains AHAs. 12. **Saturday Skin Carrot + Niacinamide Moisturizing Cream - 6/10** *Pros:* Hydrating thick gel cream. *Cons:* Smells so strong of silicone. *Bottom Line:* Bought it in Europe, loved it. Bought it in the US, smelled like straight up silicone. Different formula maybe? 13. **Glossier Future Dew - 0/10** *Pros:* Cute packaging. *Cons:* Made me look like a greasy pizza, broke me out and don’t like the smell. 14. **Versed Sunday Morning Antioxidant Oil-Serum – 1/10** *Pros:* inexpensive. *Cons*: Does nothing. The biphase ends up looking gross and muddled after a while. 15. **Murmure Bisou Clarifying Dry Oil – 10/10** *Pros:* Cleared my blackheads, sinks into the skin fast. *Cons:* Contains hazelnut oil so be careful if you have an allergy! *Bottom Line*: I use it about 2x a week at night (not on the same day as my retinol). My skin is always less red and bumpy in the AM. 16. **Typology Glycolic Acid 10% - 3/10** *Pros:* Affordable (Typology is like the French version of the Ordinary). *Cons*: Broke me out, 10% glycolic acid is too strong for my skin. 17. **Nuxe Huile Prodigieuse Multi-Purpose Dry Oil – 9/10** *Pros:* Nice dry oil that soaks in quickly, love the smell (I only use this on my body so the fragrance doesn’t bother me). *Cons:* Wish it had a dropper or pump to make application less messy. *Bottom Line:* I put this all over my body after my shower and my skin feels baby soft. 18. **Innisfree Daily UV Defense Sunscreen 36 SPF – 5/10** *Pros:* Good value for money. *Cons:* Broke me out, a little too oily. *Bottom Line:* They have changed the formula since I tried it so I cant speak for the new formulation. 19. **La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5+ - 7/10** *Pros:* Super soothing and healing. *Cons:* clogged my pores (avoid if you have acne or milia prone skin). *Bottom Line:* I would buy again for my eyelid dermatitis that I get every winter For who? Dry, irritated skin. 20. **SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic Serum - 8/10** *Pros:* Brightened and evened my skin tone. *Cons:* So expensive it hurts! Oxidized at around the 4 month mark. Smells slightly unpleasant. *Bottom Line:* One of the most effective formulas for vitamin c that Ive tried. Keep it away from light and to close the bottle tightly so it doesn’t oxidize as quickly. 21. **Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Ultra-fine Mist – 1/10** *Pros:* Cute packaging. *Cons:* Broke me out, overpowering candy fragrance, didn’t hydrate. 22. **Pillow Talk Derm Major Fade Flash Mask – 0/10** *Pros:* I can’t speak to the effectiveness of the product because my skin couldn’t handle it. *Cons:* Instantly burned my face into a red mess. *Bottom Line:* 15% glycolic acid was too much for my skin. Make sure to always patch test new products. 23. **The Outset Nourishing Squalane Daily Moisturizer – 7/10** *Pros:* Clean ingredients list, nice light texture. *Cons:* Not hydrating enough for my skin. *Bottom Line:* If you have sensitive skin and like a lightweight moisturizer it might be worth a try. 24. **Aquaphor Healing Ointment Advanced Therapy – 10/10** *Pros:* Heals, hydrates/seals in moisture. *Cons:* Packaging is kinda ugly. *Bottom Line:* Cult classic for good reason. I’m team Aquaphor over vasaline every day. 25. **Skinfix Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream – 10/10** *Pros:* Super hydrating and nourishing. Nice cream gel texture. *Cons:* none. *Bottom Line:* My sensitive skin loves this moisturizer. Even though I have acne prone skin I still prefer their normal triple lipid over their gel version. 26. **Saturday Skin Yuzu Vitamin C Sleep Mask – 4/10** *Pros:* slightly brightening. *Cons:* Strong smell, contains citrus oils, feels quite sticky. 27. **Youth to the People Superfood Air-Whip Moisture Cream – 3/10** *Pros:* nice light airy texture. *Cons:* Has fragrance and limonene. Didn’t do much. *Bottom Line:* Last time I was at sephora I did notice that the cream is no longer a light green color, so I think they changed the formula. 28. **Caudalie Beauty Elixir Face Mist – 0/10** *Pros:* None. *Cons:* Doesn’t smell great, does nothing, has alcohol, fragrance, rosemary oil, citral, linalool, citronellol…). *Bottom Line:* Outdated product imo. 29. **Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen 40 SPF – 5/10** *Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast. *Cons:* Expensive and broke me out. Feels very silicone heavy. like my skin was suffocating. *Bottom Line:* Sensitive acne prone skin beware. 30. **U beauty The Plasma Lip Compound (Rose) – 0/10** *Pros:* Couldn’t keep it on my lips long enough. *Cons:* Smells so bad like straight up chemicals. *Bottom Line:* So disappointing because it was really expensive. 31. **Youth to the People Polypeptide-121 Future Cream – 7/10** *Pros:* Hydrating and plumping. *Cons:* Started to smell a little funny when I got halfway through the jar. 32. **Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm – 8/10** *Pros:* Nice creamy texture that melts into the skin. Smells delicious and removes makeup well. *Cons:* Leaves a greasy film on my eyes Bottom Line: One of the few glow recipe products that I actually like. 33. **Fresh Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream (Night) – 1/10** *Pros:* lovely texture. *Cons:* Smells way too strong, like straight up perfume. Has citral, limonene, lemon peel oil and fragrance. *Bottom Line:* Sensitive skin beware. 34. **Typology Niacinamide 12% - 5/10** *Pros:* Inexpensive. *Cons:* 12% niacinamide is too strong for my skin. *Bottom Line:* studies show that your skin reacts best at a 4% concentration. I like to add a little into my moisturizer every so often to dilute it. 35. **Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask – 3/10** *Pros:* Smells delicious (but has fragrance). *Cons:* Made my lips more dry. I don’t like having to scoop into a jar. *Bottom Line:* I don’t understand the hype of this product. 36. **Clarins Lip Comfort Oil - 9/10** *Pros:* Not sticky, lasts a while and very shiny. *Cons:* Wish there was more color payoff and kinda pricey (not doir expensive but getting there). *Bottom Line:* My fav lip product to date.",

        "body": "Hi everyone! A little while ago, I posted a review of all of the moisturizers I tried over the years and since so many of you seemed to enjoy it (thank you again for all the love 🥹), I thought it was time for an updated version.(P.S: Price/Rating comparaison is on the last page). I received a ton of recommendations both in the comments and through private messages about moisturizers I should try next. I’ve added 10 new moisturizers that I’ve personally tested since then. For context, I test all products for at least 3 weeks, unless they cause a negative reaction (like irritation, breakouts…), in which case I stop using them. **About me:** I'm 27 F, I have combination/sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts. **The most important** for me in a moisturizer is that it keeps my skin moisturized (duh!) but with no heavy, greasy or oily finish, all at a reasonable price. **Bonus points for:** - Sits well under makeup (so that I don’t have to buy 2 different moisturizers). - Enjoyable texture. - Nice light scent (if any). - Cute & eco-responsible packaging.",

        "body": "I have been using Byoma Milky toner for about a month now, and my skin has never been more soft, hydrated and plump since my early 20’s (33 now). Previous I was dealing with my face feeling super tight, rough and irritated as I kept having random bouts of contact dermatitis and left my eyes, forehead, and upper lip scaly, red and dry for several months. I was really upset about this, but kept seeing people talking about this product and thought I may as well give it a go, not giving it much hope. I don’t know if it’s just a coincidence or it really is the toner, but I love it and it makes me skin feel so good! This will now be a staple for me! I’ll insert some pictures of my skin since using the toner.",

But now, the lines under my eyes has gotten worse. I feel like my oval face somehow got longer and face is dropping. I feel like my face shape has changed. I don’t look like myself. I’ve compared it to pics of the last few years. I hate every selfie I take and every photo someone else takes, it wasn’t like that before. I’m confused and sad about what I see in the mirror. I’m meeting someone I haven’t seen in a year and I’m so anxious. I’m also upset that I’ve been using Tretinoin for over 7 months now and this is still happening. It’s supposed to be “anti aging”. My acne has improved but my skin still looks terrible on top of everything else. I’ve never had clear skin despite taking good care of it. I don’t know what to do",

        "body": "First three pics show how bad my skin looked on a regular basis for over a year, the third shows what a “good” skin day for me looked like. The last three show my skin’s progress since December 25th with the last one being taken today, yes it cleared that quickly. I am on birth control and I have dermatillomania, so I was in denial about this being caused by my cera ve foaming facial cleanser and daily moisturizing lotion for quite a long time. But recently, when my skin would clear up for a day or two, I realized I rarely picked if I didn’t already have white heads. I also noticed that if I used more than a tiny pump of the CV moisturizer, my face would erupt with white heads by the next day. Because I couldn’t use more than a tiny amount, my skin developed horribly bad dry patches with tons of flaking dead skin. I think my skin barrier was broken and I didn’t ever cover it with makeup, but I was still horribly insecure about my skin looking like this all the time. Fast forward to Christmas, my wonderful boyfriend got me some products I had done a little research on and asked for. I was interested in double cleansing so I asked for Dermatica’s caring squalane cream cleanser, Dr. Sam’s flawless cleanser, and La Roche Posay’s Touleraine double repair moisturizer and cicaplast balm. I threw the Cera ve products under the sink and immediately used the Dr Sam’s cleanser, the double repair moisturizer, and the cicaplast balm(as a spot treatment for the dry patches). I expected a breakout from so many new products but I didn’t really care, I knew I needed to stop using the cera ve immediately. I truly was not expecting my skin to look AMAZING the next morning. For the first time in over a year, my dull, red, irritated skin had a healthy glow. The dry patches were better, my blemishes looked so much less irritated. It looked like my skin had literally healed overnight. I was truly shocked, I really expected a transition breakout but I still don’t recommend for anyone to try so many products at once. Just because it worked out for me doesn’t mean it will for someone else. I plan on integrating the cream wash soon. Does anyone have any advice for double cleansing? Should it only be used for days I wear makeup and need to remove it, or is it suitable for the daily routine? Right now I am due for my period and I have had two hormonal pimples, and I know hormonal acne cannot be treated topically but they only stuck around for two days and are going away, as opposed to being there for a week hurting and swollen, and leaving dark blemishes after healing. To me, these events confirmed that the Cera Ve was very bad for my skin. I just wish I had realized sooner than this, I thought my acne was just really bad because of my picking getting worse after my beloved cat died suddenly last year. I am truly so happy now though, my confidence has soared the past few days because my skin seriously hasnt been this clear in OVER A YEAR. Not only do I have significantly less pimples, but my skin tone is more even, I have a lot less texture, and it actually glows now. Oh and it’s probably worth mentioning that I started using Cera Ve last Christmas. I hope this post gives anyone struggling with similar issues some hope, I know just how much skin problems can affect self confidence. Woof sorry this got so long, Im just so freaking ecstatic about this.",

I used to just be covered in big red scabs every day of my life. I would open every single pimple or blackhead or any bump. Even if it didn’t have a head! I would just scrape the skin open. I couldn’t control myself, I would stand in front of the mirror for 20-30 mins picking at things that weren’t there, and not even realize how much time had passed. I decided to get really into skincare and learn as much as I could about it. I started a routine with gentle products, morning and night. It took a long time to get to a place where I’m consistent every day but once I did, I felt less inclined to pick. It felt like I put so much effort into keeping my skin soft and clean, I became very averse to destroying those efforts. ~Routine~ AM * Aveeno Calm & Restore cleanser * Aveeno Calm & Restore serum * Vanicream SPF 30 Moisturizer PM * Aveeno Calm & Restore cleanser (swap out for Neutrogena Stubborn Texture Cleanser twice a week) * CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream I also started keeping acne patches EVERYWHERE. In my purse, in my car, in the bathroom, in my bedside table, in the livingroom, at work, etc. I would put them on any time I got in the car because I did a lot of mindless picking while driving. In addition to putting them on whenever I knew I had a scab or pimple that would really trigger me to pick. Out of sight out of mind. I would use my bathroom without turning the lights on so I wouldn’t notice any blemishes on my face and wind up getting sucked into the mirror. It’s been a long road but I’m so happy to be where I am now. I finally feel like I have control and it feels so good. Just wanted to share!",

If in this time you skin feels tight it’s dry, if it gets shiny it’s oily, if some places are tight and some are oily it’s combination, if everything is fine it’s normal. Moreover, I’m no expert but I think you might just be trying too many things in a too short time frame. 4 months may seem like a lot but personally it took me 4 months of consistently using the same products to start seeing results I was happy with. I don’t know what’s the normal time to see results, but I’m just trying to say that with skincare one of the most important aspects is consistency.",

        "body": "I did something really bad. I stopped my routine in the summer. Before that I used cerave foaming face wash and cetaphil moisturizer and did a lot of experimenting for dark spots with faded topicals, the ordinary( azelaic acid, ethalyated ascorbic acid) and inky list vitamin c with EGF. The topicals faded worked at some point. However I also started LRP cicaplast baume b5 and switched to cerave cream for dry skin from the lotion. I would put both on. Anywho, I stopped it all for a period of time in the summer and got a whole slough of open and closed comedones. A girl from Sephora shelled me build a good routine by adding niacinamide and hylauronic acid with stick with the foaming cleanser and cetaphil lotion. She also recommended Causalie Beightening serum for the dark marks that would appear when the open and closed comedowns go away. I realize now that the actives have been compromising my skin barrier hence why the dark spots would go away but my skin still wasn't really glass skin. So now I am think about focusing on fixing my skin barrier and never going back to actives. I learned cerave and cetaphil aren't helping the closed commodores right now or ever so I wanna Switch to vanicream face wash and aveeno oat soothing cream. Then eventually switching to the vanicream jar for sensitive skin in the winter. I feel like this will solve my problems. I just wanted to hear a second opinion on this. Also is vani cream and aveeno better than LRP alternatives(tolerating cleanser and double moisturizer)? And lastly for sunscreen is Elta MD a good choice for dry skin with compromised barrier? Is the caudalie brightening serum worth keeping?",

        "body": "PHOTOS: First 3 are before the allergic reaction. Next two are during allergic reaction, and last three are IMMEDIATELY after the reaction (within days of my skin returning to normal) In late December, I posted on this subreddit (or the tretinoin one, I can’t remember) in a panic because I was having a SEVERE allergic reaction on my face and I didn’t know it. Backstory. I’ve had acne for years without any change. It was never severe, but always VERY stubborn. I’ve basically had at least one pimple on my face every single day for the past 5 years. My skin in general was always so dull and covered in odd texture and dark marks and a pimple here and there. When the pimple would go away (whether I picked it or not), it would leave behind hyperpigmentation but also occasionally these raised scars, mostly on my forehead and a few around my nose. They were not super visible in person, but in photographs, depending on the lighting, the texture was very visible. I tried everything to get rid of these raised bumps/scars on my forehead, including derma rolling, chemical peels, aha’s and bha’s, etc etc. Finally, in August of last year, I began tretinoin. I did not experience any kind of purge on tretinoin and also saw ZERO change in my skin from August to December of 2023. When I say no change, I mean no improvements OR worsening of my acne, no dry skin or flakes or redness or irritation or anything. I worked my way from 0.001% to 0.025% to 0.05% during these 5 months and saw absolutely zero change in my acne or texture. Then, around the end of December, I got the Tower 28 Rescue spray and began using it in conjunction with tretinoin. Within DAYS of using it, my face erupted in these super itchy and disgusting hives (as you can see in Photos 4 and 5). The reaction lasted exactly 6 days, and when it was gone, my skin was the best it’s genuinely ever been outside of childhood. My skin was PERFECTLY smooth, with zero of those raised bumps anywhere on my skin, and even a lot of my hyperpigmentation disappeared. IN SIX. DAYS. After the reaction, I didn’t start using tretinoin again until May, so around 5 months. During that five month period, I would only rinse my face with water and use a bit of moisturizer before bed and I cannot remember having a single pimple during this time. not one. In May, I began using Tretinoin again and now I will occasionally get a small spot, barely worth labelling a pimple, but this time the tretinoin seems to be working and the remaining hyperpigmentation that was left after the reaction subsided is slowly starting to go away. Essentially, I have the best skin of my adult life due completely to a random allergic reaction I got combining tretinoin and Tower 28 spray. I have kept the spray to this day in case I ever need to give myself another one of these miracle allergic reactions (kidding!!!….only a little). Anyways, my mom thinks the allergic reaction kickstarted a powerful immune response in my skin that healed everything, but if anyone else has an idea as to why this happened, pls share!!",

In my 30s & recently started noticing worsening dark hyperpigmentation on my forehead so I looked into tretinoin and that, along with morning is just la roche hydrating cleanser, vitamin c serum, & sunscreen. I alternate nights I use tretinoin every other nights and I use the ordinary niacinamide on nights I don’t use tret and I moisturize every night. Only takes me about the same amount of time that it takes to brush my teeth. Still have the dark forehead spots though they’re fading",
