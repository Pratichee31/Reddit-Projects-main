I, 31F agreed to go out for dinner with this guy, 33M and things were fine. He was a bit serious, not very engaging in the sense where he mostly talked about his work in accounting and his soccer hobby. Dinner was ok but then he said \u201cThis was nice, I don\u2019t want it to end yet.\u201d And me, I said \u201cOh there\u2019s a salt and straw down the street. Do you want some and walk around?\u201d He agreed but didn\u2019t want any ice cream once we got to the counter. Fine, I\u2019m not forcing someone to have anything, but as he\u2019s talking and walking, the ice cream in my cone started to melt a bit and I dripped some on my shirt. I laughed it off a bit, saying oops and I got out my tide pen and cleaned it off. He was a bit miffed about it I felt and suddenly had to call it a night because he had an early morning, sure that\u2019s fine. I go home and the next morning I see a message from him saying he doesn\u2019t see us going further because he felt like I should be more mature for my age and that being messy is not cute?? Sure! No one wants to spill food on themselves on a first date but damn, tough crowd. I laugh it off because I didn\u2019t think it was that serious but I guess that\u2019s an ick for men now.","target_comment_text":"An immature person wouldn\u2019t have a Tide pen in their purse ready to go.. also wtf some foods are just messy duh..he sounds like a prick."},{"opportunity_id":"comment_n39hfth","opportunity_type":"Reply to Comment","post_title":"Is my boyfriend of 10+ years really a monster?","post_body":"Ok this is crazy to me. I don't even want to ask this, but I recently seen a news article about a husband and wife that the wife died because of eye drops... well this sparked major concern for me. And let me explain why... So my boyfriend and I have had a seriously toxic relationship on and off for 10 years. A lot of fighting, and yeah trust me l've been to counseling... everything. I just recently got back with him because he seemed like he wanted to actually make it work this time... we had been traveling on the road for the last 2 years.. so he got a apartment and he is completely moved in and I just have a suit case and a few things.. so l've been unpacking the last few weeks and I noticed how many eye drop containers he has I just put them all in a pile and kind of forgot about it until now. I seen this news article and I didn't even know this was possible. And it also dawned on me that i have literally never seen him use them... 10+ years traveling on the road... never once. I'm confused, concerned, and worried. Am I being crazy?","target_comment_text":"I mean if you are seriously considering whether this guy might poison you, I think the crazy part is the fact that you\u2019re still with him. Seeing a large number of anything and jumping to omg maybe he\u2019ll hurt me with these is so crazy far from normal."},{"opportunity_id":"comment_n39kxh9","opportunity_type":"Reply to Comment","post_title":"Is my boyfriend of 10+ years really a monster?","post_body":"Ok this is crazy to me.

How hard is it for you to date right now?","post_body":"I always hear and read online about how men are struggling to get women to acknowledge them, to go on dates, to date/commit, etc. The male loneliness epidemic or whatever. Do you feel women are put off or more reluctant or less interested? I\u2019m not sure if that makes sense. I\u2019m curious as to how it really is vs all these \u201ccase studies\u201d and articles.

I prioritized my goals in life, which completely destroyed any chances of dating\u2014let alone talking to women or having sex (I'm still a virgin). I turned down opportunities for relationships and sex when they came up. Now that I\u2019m in a comfortable place in life, trying to date is the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. The anxiety I feel when approaching women is overwhelming. I\u2019ve tried and paid for countless dating apps, speed dating events, etc., but nothing has worked. I\u2019m tired of being labeled a red flag just because I lack relationship and sexual experience. Why is this so damn difficult? (Apparently I'm viewed as unwanted hence the red flag) Am I doomed to be single forever just because I have no past experience? I\u2019ve got my life together\u2014I\u2019m a homeowner, financially stable, have my own car\u2014but it feels like none of that matters unless you've already had relationships in the past. What the hell am I supposed to do?!"},{"opportunity_id":"post_1m43nhj","opportunity_type":"Reply to Post","post_title":"I think I made a big mistake and let go of a really good guy","post_body":"Been seeing this guy for a few months now, we met on hinge and were both really into eachother after the first date. From there on out, everything was great. He 27) and I (F25) would see eachother a lot and enjoyed our time, he knew how to communicate well with me. I got used to our routine. My job demands a lot of travel and I\u2019ve had some personal trips in the past few weeks. When I went on a work trip a few weeks ago, I didn\u2019t talk to him as much while being gone. I knew he was going on a trip the day after I got back. I was so busy on my work trip and remember being at the airport on the way back thinking how I was so excited to see him and I knew I was going to want to talk to him as soon as I got home. Ever since then, things have been off. We both had travels and tried to keep it up but it was hard. We spoke about being more serious, both affirmed our strong feelings for one another, but wanted to take things slowly given that our schedules are so vastly different. I know how I felt in the beginning and know it\u2019s not how I\u2019m feeling now because we aren\u2019t showing as much outright interest in one another. I\u2019ve felt that he wasn\u2019t communicating as much, not showing as much interest, I just didn\u2019t feel pursued. He and I had a serious conversation about it and I felt like things were ok but it started to happen again. We spoke yesterday and decided to end things, he said he hasn\u2019t been feeling it for a few weeks now, ever since I went on my work trip. I initiated ending things, and he agreed. Everything was amicable but I\u2019m so sad. He\u2019s treated me better than any guy I\u2019ve met and was respectful and good at communicating. He didn\u2019t say he wasn\u2019t feeling it until I said I didn\u2019t like where things stood. I have some serious past trauma and some poor experiences with relationships so he was just a breath of fresh air. I knew I had some reservations and that my needs weren\u2019t being met, but he is a good person and I feel like I\u2019m making a mistake pushing him away. I felt ok in the moment but now feel sad. He meant more to me than I realized. Is there any hope here? Or do I move on."}]
