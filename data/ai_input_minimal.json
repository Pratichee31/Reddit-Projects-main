A little while ago, I posted a review of all of the moisturizers I tried over the years and since so many of you seemed to enjoy it (thank you again for all the love \ud83e\udd79), I thought it was time for an updated version.(P.S: Price/Rating comparaison is on the last page). I received a ton of recommendations both in the comments and through private messages about moisturizers I should try next. I\u2019ve added 10 new moisturizers that I\u2019ve personally tested since then. For context, I test all products for at least 3 weeks, unless they cause a negative reaction (like irritation, breakouts\u2026), in which case I stop using them. **About me:** I'm 27 F, I have combination/sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts. **The most important** for me in a moisturizer is that it keeps my skin moisturized (duh!) but with no heavy, greasy or oily finish, all at a reasonable price. **Bonus points for:** - Sits well under makeup (so that I don\u2019t have to buy 2 different moisturizers). - Enjoyable texture. - Nice light scent (if any). - Cute & eco-responsible packaging."},{"opportunity_id":"comment_mpc1w4t","opportunity_type":"Reply to Comment","post_title":"Is this what normal skin is supposed to look like?","post_body":"I'm really confused, am I doing something wrong in my routine?
