        "body": "M 29, East Coast. After years of trying to improve myself, I finally got myself in dating shape and get matches on Hinge now. Here's my dilemma - I'm open to dating anyone. However, I do have a preference for South Indian women, because I'm South Indian myself. I have a desire to share inside jokes in my language, share my culture and I feel like a South Indian woman would understand me better. Once I started dating, their behavior on dating apps and in-person feels disappointing. In general, Indian women come across as more entitled and expect more for me. There is a more pronounced attitude of \"\"I'm here, impress me\"\", \"\"What can you do for me?\"\" or \"\"Prove your worth to me\"\". I dated a few Caucasian women as well, and the difference was mind blowing to me. They were more present, asked me questions about myself, and actually seemed interested in getting to know me. They're more responsive in texts and say interesting stuff that I can respond to. They've offered to split the bill on dates, and generally just seem more interested in dating as a process where two people get to know each other. This is very much a sweeping generalization, I'm aware. It could just be the kind of women I happened to match with. It's just confusing to me. It's as if Indian women expect princess treatment right off the bat. What's going on? All this time I thought it would be the reverse. Have any of you faced anything similar?",

          "body": "My experience has been identical to yours. I don‚Äôt want to insult all brown women. I date only Indian American women, married one. I think Indians are super strict on gender norms and even liberal ones have internalized biases. In 14 years of dating and married life with my ex, a doctor, she never once slipped her hand into her purse to pay for anything. Even if my hands were full with a kid. So yes, Indian women have been taught to look at a man as a provider and bank account. The guy should come with good brands too - Ivy League school, top jobs, drive a nice car, take nice vacations. Is it wrong to have high standards? No. But then it isn‚Äôt about emotions and connection first. Hang in there. Keep dating. It‚Äôs a numbers game. There are many many Indian women and hopefully you find one with more substance.",

You're in your late 20s, the brown girls who were genuinely attracted to Indian guys have already found the one they want to marry and you're getting the leftovers who are likely white worshipers and spent their younger 20s sleeping around and see you as their ticket to securing their future. Also, when you date a brown girl she is always going to run to her father if there is an argument in your relationship, so be prepared for that. It's so disrespectful.",

Some men feel owed sex and attention just for existing, and some women use people for validation, money, or ego boosts. People want intimacy without effort, connection without vulnerability, and healing without accountability. Add dating apps into the mix, and you get a nonstop loop of ghosting, games, and surface-level nonsense. Until more people do the real work on themselves, it‚Äôs going to keep being a mess. I also feel like people are not patient. Like it can take some time to find the right person. This isnt Uber eats where you can just order anything you want lol",

Dinner was ok but then he said ‚ÄúThis was nice, I don‚Äôt want it to end yet.‚Äù And me, I said ‚ÄúOh there‚Äôs a salt and straw down the street. Do you want some and walk around?‚Äù He agreed but didn‚Äôt want any ice cream once we got to the counter. Fine, I‚Äôm not forcing someone to have anything, but as he‚Äôs talking and walking, the ice cream in my cone started to melt a bit and I dripped some on my shirt. I laughed it off a bit, saying oops and I got out my tide pen and cleaned it off. He was a bit miffed about it I felt and suddenly had to call it a night because he had an early morning, sure that‚Äôs fine. I go home and the next morning I see a message from him saying he doesn‚Äôt see us going further because he felt like I should be more mature for my age and that being messy is not cute?? Sure!

If you go to the tourist parts of Thailand, you'll see plenty of Thai village girls who rotate white western \"\"boyfriends\"\". Sometimes it ends in a marriage, and the girl gets to have a better life with a rich white dude. If you go to Sri Lanka, dirt poor Sri Lankan surfers do the same with well off European and Slavic tourists. I was in Arugam Bay in SL not too long ago, literally all the Sri Lankan surfers guys act as surfing instructors *and* short-term boyfriends for a white female tourists who pay for everything. This is a legitimate hustle. Once this woman's visa expires, he moves on to the next white girl. Often it ends in a marriage, and the guy has a better life. Literally there are studies on this, but not many people know about it outside of Sri Lanka. I'm a Western-raised Sri Lankan, and even I didn't know about this until a year ago. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328159877_Exploring_the_Relationship_between_Beach_Boys_and_Tourists_Using_Host-guest_Theory_The_Case_of_Bentota_Sri_Lanka I thought I'd share just to debunk a lot of the absolute horseshit on here about South Asian men's dating prospects.

I just recently got back with him because he seemed like he wanted to actually make it work this time... we had been traveling on the road for the last 2 years.. so he got a apartment and he is completely moved in and I just have a suit case and a few things.. so l've been unpacking the last few weeks and I noticed how many eye drop containers he has I just put them all in a pile and kind of forgot about it until now. I seen this news article and I didn't even know this was possible. And it also dawned on me that i have literally never seen him use them... 10+ years traveling on the road... never once.

        "body": "This is something I‚Äôve noticed over the years and have been meaning to talk about not in a bitter way, just genuinely curious. When I see AMWF couples whether it's in the U.S., or even countries like Korea, especially in person or on social media, a surprising number of them seem to involve European women either women who were born and raised in Europe or who moved to the U.S. later in life (for the AM + WF female couples I see in the states). It‚Äôs noticeably less common (at least from what I see) to find AM + WF couples where the white woman is a standard American-born Emily from Georgia or Connecticut. It makes me wonder why that is. Personally, as an Asian guy who grew up in the U.S., I‚Äôve definitely felt the quiet pressure that comes from being seen as less attractive in the dating scene especially by American-born white women. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs always intentional, but the way media portrays us, and how we‚Äôre often stereotyped, has a real effect. You grow up knowing you‚Äôre not the ‚Äúdefault‚Äù type that most girls swoon over in teen movies or on dating apps. And that leaves a mark, whether you want it to or not. But when I talk to or observe European women, there just seems to be a different vibe. I don‚Äôt feel that same wall go up. They‚Äôre often more curious, more open-minded, and don‚Äôt carry as many of the unspoken stereotypes that sometimes come with dating in the U.S. It feels like there‚Äôs less of that ‚Äúproving yourself‚Äù dynamic. Of course, I‚Äôm not saying all European women are more open, or that all American women are closed off. I‚Äôve met exceptions to both. But I do think growing up in different cultural environments affects how people see race, masculinity, and what they find attractive. And I wonder if that‚Äôs part of why more AMWF couples seem to involve Europeans. Just wanted to put that out there and hear what others think. Have you noticed this too? If you‚Äôre in an AMWF relationship, what‚Äôs your experience been like? Especially if your partner is European vs American-born.",

From listening in on American discourse, I've gotten the sense that I could never date an Asian there because this would be viewed as me being a fetishist or the AM being some colonizer-loving lapdog.

But somehow, my parents still think I need to check in with them like I‚Äôm in high school. They have always wanted daily updates, which I‚Äôve been doing out of respect daily calls, messages, etc. Lately though, it‚Äôs turned into random video calls at odd hours, and if I miss one or don‚Äôt reply immediately, they get all dramatic. And now there‚Äôs this weird tension because I think they‚Äôve caught on that I might have a girlfriend (I do). Her parents aren‚Äôt thrilled either classic caste drama. The funniest part? She‚Äôs also born and raised in London. Like, how are we still stuck in this mindset? Anyway, my mum‚Äôs been super rude recently on calls snapping, passive-aggressive, or straight-up cold. If I ask her calmly why she‚Äôs talking like that, she will start crying, hangs up and then tells my dad some twisted version of what happened. It genuinely feels like I‚Äôm in a toxic relationship‚Ä¶ except it‚Äôs my own parents. I‚Äôm not doing anything wild just living my life. But the guilt-tripping, the controlling behavior, the emotional blackmail it‚Äôs getting exhausting. How does one deal with this kind of stuff? Did you set boundaries? Did it work, or just blow up in your face? I don‚Äôt want to cut them off or anything, especially due to the fact that they are immigrants too and don‚Äôt have a big social circle like they did as they are getting older‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm not 16 anymore and I‚Äôm tired of feeling like I‚Äôm doing something wrong for just existing as an adult.",

Then the classic line comes out you may be but you should consult anyways the experience and care of parents will always be good for you. Their idea is still 200 years old and far from reality. So what I do is I let them know and ignore their suggestions and do whatever I think is the best. What I have realised is that they are lonely and they played significant role in bringing us up but now that we are grown up they find themselves irrelevant and ignored. Leading to all this emotional drama. So my suggestion is tell them you are old and would like to take your decisions as situation is different abroad and listen to them once a while but chose to do what is right for you",

        "title": "I realized being the ‚Äúsafe guy‚Äù in dating can feel eerily similar to being a really attractive girl",
        "body": "A while ago, I read a post here from a woman who talked about how being very attractive actually made dating harder for her. She said men often didn‚Äôt see her for who she really was ‚Äî they projected fantasies, assumed she was out of their league, or treated her like a trophy. Some felt insecure dating her, and some even left her for women they saw as more ‚Äúattainable.‚Äù On the outside, it looked like she had every advantage. But she described feeling isolated, misunderstood, and constantly underestimated in relationships. That post really stuck with me. And the more I thought about it, the more I saw a weird parallel in my own experience ‚Äî but from the other side of the spectrum. I‚Äôm not ‚Äúintimidatingly hot,‚Äù but I‚Äôve come to realize I give off the vibe of being too safe. I‚Äôm 28. I‚Äôm an attorney. I own my home, my car‚Äôs paid off, I dress decently (mostly because of work), and I have strong relationships with my family and friends. I go to church, I travel, I‚Äôm social, and I‚Äôve worked hard to build a stable, intentional life. But that stability ‚Äî the very thing I thought would be attractive ‚Äî seems to get me boxed in as the ‚Äúboring but reliable‚Äù guy. The one you come back to after you‚Äôre done chasing excitement. And it sucks. Because like that woman, I‚Äôm not what people assume at first glance. I‚Äôm spontaneous, emotionally available, adventurous, and I‚Äôve had deep, fun, passionate relationships. But I still get this sense that women I date are treating the relationship differently ‚Äî like they‚Äôre being cautious because they think I‚Äôm already in ‚Äúhusband mode.‚Äù One woman I dated for almost a couple of months told me I was everything she wanted ‚Äî stable, kind, grounded, emotionally mature. Then she left and started dating a guy who didn‚Äôt have a steady job, lived with friends, and openly admitted he wasn‚Äôt looking for commitment. Despite her saying she wanted all these other things. It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm trying to trap anyone into marriage. I just show up with real intentions and a sense of direction. But that somehow makes me feel less seen. Like that woman, I‚Äôve been told things like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre everything I should want,‚Äù but still get ghosted or passed over for someone more ‚Äúfun.‚Äù And it leaves me wondering ‚Äî am I actually boring? Or is it just that I don‚Äôt present chaos disguised as chemistry? Similar to the original post, I feel like I‚Äôm often misunderstood, treated differently or like I‚Äôm out of someone‚Äôs league and I get left for people seen as more attainable. I‚Äôm not bitter. I know relationships are complex, and I‚Äôve had my share of good ones. But that post made me realize something I hadn‚Äôt put into words before: that being seen as too stable or too safe can make people overlook the very real spark, passion, and depth underneath. I guess I‚Äôm just wondering ‚Äî has anyone else felt this? Like you‚Äôre constantly filtered through a label you didn‚Äôt choose, and people don‚Äôt take the time to actually see you?",

He‚Äôs also really sweet and funny, so over time I developed a bit of a crush on him. Now I want to ask him out, but I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôve been mistaking his basic kindness during the course as interest. For example, during class he will ask me how I did on the homework and if I didn‚Äôt do well or understand something, he will help fix my errors. Anytime we are in groups, he compliments my handwriting (I will try to tease him a little about his handwriting since it‚Äôs a little messy lol), he will tell jokes to me, initiate conversations and tell me about his job, maintains strong eye contact during conversation (maybe this is just normal?), and one day he even pushed in my chair for me after I got up and the class was ending. The overall dynamic is very playful and relaxed. Do you think this sounds like interest or just basic friendliness? I do have his number, so I think when classes are over ( this week), I‚Äôll text him and ask if he would like to go out sometime either way. I just kind of want to know if I‚Äôm being delusional before I send anything haha. Thank you guys in advance!",

So yeah‚Ä¶ it took me 35 years to understand this, and in this video I break down and dissect it every step along the way from the moment we are born to even living a decently eventful life into our 30s and 40s. If you're just 20 something and are wondering why accomplishing goals, getting that job, getting the watch/phone/car everybody likes and admires, getting hitched by a certain age to a \"\"safe\"\" girl to live a safe and secure life is making you feel miserable, lost and confused, maybe take a listen to understand why, and most importantly what you might have to do to get around it.",

        "body": "Of course, this is a very person to person thing and it's not something that can be generally answered. Most people that grew up here in Germany would have come across someone with obvious signs of a mental illness (such as self harm scars) at some point and it's generally more normal for these issues to be talked about and communicated. But I know from friends that grew up in Asia, that it's more something being kept quiet about and hidden, so likely everyone would try their best to hide such scars. In my online dating profiles I use a picture where they are visible (not super huge scars but taking a closer look easy to notice) and do bring up the existence of this psychological illness on a first or second date. The two or three times I went up to someone on the street and basically said \"\"hey, I think you have a cute smile/you're cute, could I have your number\"\", it was usually summer and my arm would therefore be visible in something short sleeved. Would you find scars itself on a person be enough of a turn off to not even match with them/get to know them if everything else seemed good? Or do you personally see it as a big hindrance?",

Ross Butler, who is of mixed descent, fits the profile of the romantic lead ‚Äî \"\"He's a masculine Asian man. He's stereotype-breaking, and we love that ‚Äî we need to have that in our culture,\"\" he says",
        "body": "Producers on the US-Canada romantic comedy-drama Worth The Wait ‚Ä¶ faced pressure from Hollywood financiers ‚Ä¶ to add a white male to the cast rather than letting the film be an all-Asian ensemble. https://www.asiaone.com/entertainment/producers-all-asian-rom-com-worth-wait-reject-hollywood-pressure-cast-white-actors \"\"They gave me a list of white guys we could cast. If we could give one of the roles to them, we could get funded. It was so tempting,\"\" ‚Ä¶ The investors held the belief that, except for genres such as martial arts, Asian male characters are not bankable, with little appeal for Western audiences, she says. Tan and her team ignored the suggestion, completing Worth The Wait without watering down their goal of an all-Asian cast in stereotype-breaking stories. ‚Ä¶ Slated to open in Singapore cinemas in August *[note: produced by Tubi, and available online I think free since may 2025]*, Worth The Wait is directed by Taiwanese film-maker Tom Shu-Yu Lin, known for his Golden Horse-nominated drama The Garden Of Evening Mists (2019), adapted from the 2011 Booker Prize-shortlisted novel of the same name by Malaysian author Tan Twan Eng. Set in Seattle and Kuala Lumpur, it revolves around a group of singles and couples of different ages, and features actors of Asian or mixed descent from North America and Europe, including Ross Butler, Lana Condor, Andrew Koji, Sung Kang and Elodie Yung, as well as Singapore actors Tan Kheng Hua and Lim Yu-Beng. ‚Ä¶ Butler ‚Ä¶ fits the profile of the romantic lead, while also being Asian. \"\"He's a masculine Asian man. He's stereotype-breaking, and we love that ‚Äî we need to have that in our culture,\"\" he says. Singapore-born American actor Butler plays Kai, the son of a corporate bigwig (Lim). On why on-screen white male-Asian female couples are the more common representation, Butler feels it has to do with Asian men being seen as not desirable. \"\"It's a deep topic to talk about. In the West, for a hundred years, the Asian man has been emasculated,\"\" ‚Ä¶ Butler drew on his personal experience to play Kai, who is under pressure to live up to his father's goals for him. The performer took chemical and biomolecular engineering at Ohio State University, but left his studies to pursue acting as a career. \"\"A lot of this was generational legacy pressure from my mum. She is from Malaysia, and she took me to the US for the opportunities. We all know about the immigrants' dream,\"\" he adds. In another of the film's intertwining story threads, a couple played by Chinese-Canadian actors Osric Chau and Karena Lam find their marriage becoming strained after a miscarriage, while a young man, Blake (Chinese-Canadian actor Ricky He), has priorities other than school. Rachel Tan says: \"\"Osric's character is vulnerable and Blake failed maths. There are so many layers to the characters. We are so much more than what's usually shown.\"\" ‚Ä¶",

The cold approach of randomly approaching a girl isn't something I've ever liked because I don't really know how to flirt and I'm pretty awkward. Being labeled as a creep is something I'm really scared of. I don't have many opportunities to meet people organically anyway since I don't go out much so it would just be the apps for me but I've heard so many bad stories about them that I find them really intimidating. I'm almost 30 and I've never had a date before and I'm worried that women will be put off by my lack of experience even if she somehow accepts my situation.",

I want to take time to get to know someone like genuinely just talk to them but it seems to be really old school nowadays. In group settings I don't know why but new people kinda avoid me even though my friends (both men and women) said I am sweet and funny. Some friends said I look kinda scary with a resting bitch face to talk to before that got to know me better. Some said I should go for the kpop look. Some said I look too feminine. Sometimes I feel like I have a weird aura that push people away. It feels so lonely but I don't even know how to tell people about that and what to change. I tried to talk to more people but it often just feels so superficial. I am pretty beat now.",

They want me to do my post secondary education in India as opposed to Canada where we currently live because it‚Äôll be cheaper, and they can be around family again. My family has been lonely since we don‚Äôt have anyone related to us here. They‚Äôve also been very stressed due to the lack of help you have access to, (no maids, family, etc). Personally, I miss my extended family as well and I‚Äôve been sad as I don‚Äôt get to see them often. I also hate the weather here because of how cold and depressing it is while I love the weather in India. I don‚Äôt really care much for the university that I‚Äôm supposed to go to either since it‚Äôs not the school I originally wanted to go to. My parents will probably end up moving to India whether or not I come as well. I am depressed thinking of a future in which I continue to have an uninteresting life away from my family. I have heard that college is funner in India than in Canada, and my family said that they would put me in a very good college. Whenever I visit India I have fun hanging out with my family but I understand that vacationing and visiting India is very different from living in the country. I‚Äôm also aware that Indian education is very different from Canadian education, and not as lenient or creative. It‚Äôll definitely be a huge change and adjustment for me, but I want to feel happier and have closer proximity with my family. Should I just suck it up and commit four years, or move to India?",

        "body": "I knew Indians had a problem with poor diet, with protein and nutrient deficiency. I didn‚Äôt know how extensive, vast, and impactful it could be to our people as a whole. So, I asked ChatGPT to look into protein deficiencies per race and analyze it. https://preview.redd.it/owtjnp1npodf1.jpg?width=1227&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=55941fa0f1965def9f3ad89308ba929e511a825c Then I thought, what would happen if the protein deficiency and other stuff were to be eliminated. So, I asked the AI to estimate how the top 10 percent of men of each race would perform under optimal diet and other conditions. First it looked at IQ and testosterone. And this was the result. NOTE: All analysis from now is based on TOP 10% males of each race optimized for the best diet and nutrition. Why? Coz everything in life, whether it be power, beauty, intelligence, athleticism, wittiness or any other quality will only be largely among top 10% of a population. This is the dominant population of a society in these categories. ‚Ä¶ When everyone in a race is concerned, like the next 10 percent, 20 percent and stuff, the analysis is also applicable to each of them, but at varying degrees of impact. So, keep that in mind. NOTE: You will see ‚ÄúHigh T‚Äù ‚ÄúExcellent T‚Äù and stuff in the analysis‚Ä¶ \"\"T\"\" refers to testosterone. https://preview.redd.it/ndbnperupodf1.jpg?width=1227&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47b457fb9e4e8f10d75fefc7610933d9c48c4308 Then I asked it for optimization strategy for Indian men and its effects. https://preview.redd.it/sz88g73wpodf1.jpg?width=1227&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=163b3a492289eedc8c4d3e0a474fb65b0e461f37 https://preview.redd.it/qsbe6hl7qodf1.jpg?width=1227&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=156252bd649e64d681fa3544d0a4cd3a2fc735eb # Now, we delve deeper into IQ stuff when top 10 percent of every race are optimized. https://preview.redd.it/vlx03w8aqodf1.jpg?width=1227&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1bf12bb8e14766f94faadaa7a18c84d47d0fd3d2 https://preview.redd.it/jlzl90fbqodf1.jpg?width=1227&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=508b3f8480080ef0101ac552ac136029be81230e https://preview.redd.it/c86ytldcqodf1.jpg?width=1227&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4597644f6c6e0e5454fd05f3350ea47a191b93e1 # Now, the facial aesthetics. top 10 percent males per race. https://preview.redd.it/8w796t2iqodf1.jpg?width=1227&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f33948efe9340643bd88f7fbed771533f062491c https://preview.redd.it/1p01ndyiqodf1.jpg?width=1227&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=64d7541b89de7073bab903d34e075d3516fa9ad5 https://preview.redd.it/xa79cmdlqodf1.jpg?width=1227&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=39efd05e4dcb112f4d719c46edd2b7a0e6055d5a https://preview.redd.it/mchrrxnmqodf1.jpg?width=1227&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4c12bd985c0715b543fdb018e728cd3c36ab7791 https://preview.redd.it/wf9oqgvoqodf1.jpg?width=1227&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=613353258c79fe9eedda9ab61f57631a06e40c05 https://preview.redd.it/ff5uwlbqqodf1.jpg?width=1227&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9433b1b40be8b81f06e36426e510c1f791f2c3a2 # Now for athletics, something everyone grumbles about.

These are estimates. Ranks may go up and down here and there or may stay for some while changing for others. Do keep that in mind. But this does show the vast potential we hold as a people if we optimize diets and stuff. This is especially true for upper-middle and upper class Indians in India and in other counties such as United States. If you have so much money, fucking use it on yourselves and your children. Educate your family members and peers as well‚ÄîDIET AND NUTRITION IS IMPORTANT. Dont have a starvation mindset when you actually do have the money to change things. So, when we do not eat proper amount of proteins and other stuff, we are basically competing with other races with one hand tied behind the back. And that too among Indians with high incomes who have all the money in the world to give thier children high nutrition but insist the diets that are highly nutritionally deficient. Imagine the impact. why would you do this to your own children. And imagine what would happen if we properly eat. I hope, this also helps those with a perennial depressive mindset who think they are doomed because of their race. coz, when you think you cant do it, you actually wont do anything. But when you know there might be potential, you might actually start putting in effort, which may or may not come to fruition. but effort is crucial. Hope this helps. Again, once more saying, take these as estimates. Dont get into your head as if everything an AI says its true. There will be truth, plus some errors. So, put in your effort, remain humble.",

And even if you marry an Indian girl, she'll be happier the more physically developed your body is.

I mean, before I learned how to dress myself and got confidence, I never got compliments except from my family.

I get that everyone wants to help, but holy hell, some of these takes are borderline sabotage. Let‚Äôs start with the obsession with 1‚Äì2 rep maxes. Why are we telling Asian guys - most of whom are starting skinny, untrained, and just want to look good to focus on powerlifting numbers? Do you really think a 5'8\"\" guy at 135 lbs trying to improve his appearance should be maxing out on deadlifts and squats every week? What‚Äôs that gonna do? Fry his CNS and maybe get him a herniated disc? Here‚Äôs the truth: 1-2RM lifting is for strength athletes. If your goal is to build muscle, look better in a t-shirt, and gain confidence, you need hypertrophy training not training like a damn Olympic lifter. You‚Äôre not stepping on a powerlifting platform. You‚Äôre trying to stop looking like a noodle. Stick to the 6‚Äì12 rep range, focus on progressive overload, get strong over time in those rep ranges, and train with proper form and intent. That‚Äôs how you grow. And don‚Äôt even get me started on ‚Äújust eat more.‚Äù What the hell does that even mean? I‚Äôve seen this advice repeated like gospel: ‚ÄúBro you just need to eat like a pig.‚Äù No mention of macros, no mention of food quality. just ‚Äúeat more.‚Äù If you blindly follow that advice, here‚Äôs what‚Äôs gonna happen: You‚Äôll gain some muscle. You‚Äôll gain a ton of fat.. And then you‚Äôll look ‚Äúskinny-fat‚Äù. soft, puffy, and still insecure as hell, We already get clowned on enough for being ‚Äúsmall‚Äù or ‚Äúfrail‚Äù. why would we encourage dirty bulks that just bloat us up and make us feel worse? Instead, tell people to: 1) Eat in a modest surplus (like 250‚Äì300 calories over maintenance) 2) Get at least 0.8‚Äì1g of protein per pound of bodyweight 3) Focus on quality calories 4) Train consistently, recover well, and stay patient",

But the problem is that their form wasn‚Äôt correct and they developed shoulder problems as they got older. You really have to focus on the proper form or else you will wind up injuring yourself. If you are a stick and are just starting out, I would recommend starting off with simple body weight exercises for a month or so. Just try doing pushups with perfect form. If you can‚Äôt even do 40 pushups, you shouldn‚Äôt be doing max bench presses. Get your body acclimated, get past the DOMS, and then progress to free weights later. Also when it comes to protein, a lot of dudes totally overdo it on the protein shakes. You don‚Äôt need to ingest a bazillion calories of protein to bulk up.

        "body": "(32M) Growing up, I never had much of a dating or sex life. I prioritized my goals in life, which completely destroyed any chances of dating‚Äîlet alone talking to women or having sex (I'm still a virgin). I turned down opportunities for relationships and sex when they came up. Now that I‚Äôm in a comfortable place in life, trying to date is the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever done. The anxiety I feel when approaching women is overwhelming. I‚Äôve tried and paid for countless dating apps, speed dating events, etc., but nothing has worked. I‚Äôm tired of being labeled a red flag just because I lack relationship and sexual experience. Why is this so damn difficult? (Apparently I'm viewed as unwanted hence the red flag) Am I doomed to be single forever just because I have no past experience? I‚Äôve got my life together‚ÄîI‚Äôm a homeowner, financially stable, have my own car‚Äîbut it feels like none of that matters unless you've already had relationships in the past. What the hell am I supposed to do?!",

Nothing over the top, just something thoughtful to make it feel special. Then I sent her a simple message. Just wanted to be clear and mature‚Äîsomething like, ‚ÄúHey, just making sure we‚Äôre both on the same page. I‚Äôm not expecting anything crazy, just mutual effort.‚Äù That‚Äôs when things shifted. Dry replies. No energy. One-word answers. Still gave her space. Then on Sunday I texted, ‚ÄúHow was your weekend?‚Äù No reply. But she was online and posting stories. And today? Noticed she‚Äôd unmatched me on Hinge too. Didn‚Äôt say a word. So basically: She asked for a surprise date. I planned one. Then I gave her a surprise too‚Äîbasic honesty.

Once both of us have spent at least a few hours in-person, it's a lot easier to put efforts in the 2nd meet (or a fancy date) and a lot less uncertainty for both. Almost half of the time my short coffee chat easily gets extended to going to more places together including my home.",

He 27) and I (F25) would see eachother a lot and enjoyed our time, he knew how to communicate well with me. I got used to our routine. My job demands a lot of travel and I‚Äôve had some personal trips in the past few weeks. When I went on a work trip a few weeks ago, I didn‚Äôt talk to him as much while being gone. I knew he was going on a trip the day after I got back. I was so busy on my work trip and remember being at the airport on the way back thinking how I was so excited to see him and I knew I was going to want to talk to him as soon as I got home. Ever since then, things have been off. We both had travels and tried to keep it up but it was hard. We spoke about being more serious, both affirmed our strong feelings for one another, but wanted to take things slowly given that our schedules are so vastly different. I know how I felt in the beginning and know it‚Äôs not how I‚Äôm feeling now because we aren‚Äôt showing as much outright interest in one another. I‚Äôve felt that he wasn‚Äôt communicating as much, not showing as much interest, I just didn‚Äôt feel pursued. He and I had a serious conversation about it and I felt like things were ok but it started to happen again. We spoke yesterday and decided to end things, he said he hasn‚Äôt been feeling it for a few weeks now, ever since I went on my work trip. I initiated ending things, and he agreed. Everything was amicable but I‚Äôm so sad. He‚Äôs treated me better than any guy I‚Äôve met and was respectful and good at communicating. He didn‚Äôt say he wasn‚Äôt feeling it until I said I didn‚Äôt like where things stood. I have some serious past trauma and some poor experiences with relationships so he was just a breath of fresh air. I knew I had some reservations and that my needs weren‚Äôt being met, but he is a good person and I feel like I‚Äôm making a mistake pushing him away. I felt ok in the moment but now feel sad. He meant more to me than I realized. Is there any hope here? Or do I move on.",

A guy who has been trying to get me to go out with him for literal years (I‚Äôm talking like 8 years) ghosted me after I decided to finally give him a chance. I only ever denied him in the past because the timing was always off. I genuinely find him attractive! He would hit me up when I was just starting to get serious with someone and wanted to pursue them exclusively, or I was too freshly out of a relationship and needed time to heal. We matched on Tinder, started chatting, and after I agreed to meet up he kept saying how excited he was. We agreed to meet up today, and made the plans on Friday. No time was set, so I checked in yesterday and we agreed for dinner plans. It‚Äôs now 11:40pm and I‚Äôve still heard nothing from this man. He only read my messages (only two from today, the first one being a response from something he said last night and the other one about the date being later that day) about an hour ago. No response, no acknowledgement, no apology, nothing. I am so confused and honestly a little hurt. I feel stupid because I was actually excited to finally go out with him, and now I just feel like a fool. I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm looking for here, I guess I just needed to scream this into the void. TLDR: ghosted by a man who‚Äôs been trying to go out with my for almost a decade",

I mean they‚Äôre the ones getting hundreds of likes on dating apps, they‚Äôre technically the ones picking ‚Äî not us lol. My grandmother used to say women are reciprocal; but only to men they want.

        "body": "Most Indians think that being the richest minority, commiting virtually no crime, and holding high status jobs such as doctors and engineers would save us from the brunt of racism. However, we can see that the complete **opposite** is happening. Nothing has gotten better. In fact, racism has gotten worse. The explanation? The second tweet perfectly encapsulates what the West‚Äôs idea of a 'model minority' is - >\"\"They could have had their gas stations & 7-11's and had a decent life here. But they learned how to code and got too arrogant.\"\" Essentially, they want a hardworking, service class that keeps their heads down at all times. As soon as you threaten their position at white collar jobs within high finance and tech, the true ugliness of it all comes out. We are already seeing narratives being maliciously twisted to fit their new racist agenda. * Indians are hardworking doctors -> Indian doctors are maliciously killing our people * Indians are the highest income earners -> Indians scam their way to the top through nepotism * Indians run tech companies -> Indians are stealing our jobs * Indians are highly educated -> Indians are pathetic, nerdy, and weak. So, what does this mean for us? Should this stop us from being successful and pursuing our goals? Absolutely **NOT**. Racism will exist and continue to do so. This shouldn‚Äôt change anything. However, we need to realize that focusing on money and education **alone** makes us a bigger target, exactly like the Jews. Other races aren't as successful as us, but they still get less mockery and hate. Perhaps we could adopt a thing or two from them. Be the highly successful and educated guy that is ALSO chill, laidback, and charismatic. More importantly, **improve your looks, physique, and fashion**. An ugly, unfit Indian will always be stereotyped as a sleazy scamming conman (halo effect). A well groomed, jacked, fashionable one that does well with women will gain more respect than ANY high salary or degree will. Ignore the noise outside, and focus on winning. üí™üèΩ",

        "body": "Saw a bunch of posts here talking about the desi women in the west that actively put down desi men while choosing to date white men and then eventually go back and settle with desi men. You gotta understand that women are just doing what benefits their self interests. The people i respect the least however are the desi men that are willing to be around women like that and actively be part of those social groups where its normal for desi women to openly hate on them. Look the reality is, you can't change people and it's not you're fault that somebody has chosen to hate on you this way but you can defintely change the people that you're around and if you recognise that a girl is like this, it's your fault for choosing to be around them. I have no sympathy for the men that don't respect themselves enough to remove themselves from environments like that. Now if a woman doest like you, she's never gonna listen to you. So there's nothing you can really do about the women, but on your side as a man you can make it a point to leave social groups like this. Cause when you just leave, that sends a message that you don't tolerate shi like this and to some extent you should tell the other desi men in the community to do the same and actually go for women that want you. Don't be out here chasing just snowbunnys either. Lotta women from every other group that exist that are cool too. Your primary concern should be how much she wants you and what she wants you for. Cause I promise you, this is the solution. Cause nobody starts caring about \"\"dating your own\"\" and \"\"the desi community have to stick together\"\" like desi women who see you with non-desi women. Trust. That's honestly the maddest thing tho, is that there's women out there that don't want you but they don't want you to be with nobody else either Cause they are afraid that their back option to settle down with no longer exists ü§£ü§£ü§£ End of the day, complaining does nothing. Hold no attachment towards people who don't care about you and keep it pushing üíØ",

          "body": "Yeah Korea is held at the highest different standard than everyone else it seems. Anything good they do is grossly undermined and any bad issues are exaggerated to the max. Look at this for example, I don‚Äôt see foreigner people in Korean subs talking about how the Korean government is implementing a large-scale debt relief program to forgive debts for low-income individuals and small business owners, particularly those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and long-term economic downturn. The program will write off debts of up to 50 million won (approximately $36,000 USD) that have been delinquent for over seven years. This initiative aims to provide a fresh start for those struggling with debt and stimulate the economy for 1.23 million small business owners and individuals. News like this doesn‚Äôt get shared but god forbid, one incident happens like a fight or a brawl they generalize all Koreans it‚Äôs ridiculous. Also for the Australia case, it seems in the western world they all gang up and target single persons because they‚Äôre afraid of going 1v1. That‚Äôs some real coward shi. When they aren‚Äôt targeting women or elderly as for young Asian dudes they will always get bold when they‚Äôre in groups.",

I‚Äôm hoping someone might be able to help me figure out possible product matches or dupes based on the look. Specifically, I‚Äôd like to know what kind of lip liner, lipstick/gloss, and eye products (like eyeshadow, eyeliner, or lashes) could give a similar effect. I found the girl who made the post: Isabellrose on Instagram and TikTok, but she didn't list the products in either post. Thanks in advance!",
